# 7 GUIs w/ XState

## What is this repo about?

This is my take on the [7 GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) tasks, using React, Typescript, and [David K. Piano's](https://twitter.com/davidkpiano) [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate), for the sake of learning about stateless machines and improving my TDD knowledge.

It doesn't provide any disruptive visuals, neither amazing usability, It's just a study of writing better tests with [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) and error handling on the state side.

## Scripts

- `yarn start` - for running the react server
- `yarn test` - for running Jest in watch mode
- `yarn coverage` - for generating the test coverage report
